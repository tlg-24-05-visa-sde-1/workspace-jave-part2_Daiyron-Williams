I've uploaded a few demos that show wildcard type parameters in action:
  <? extends E>
  <?  super  E>

Collection:
  addAll(Collection<? extends E>)

List:
  sort(Comparator<? super E>)


Both are well-commented, and you need to study them carefully.
After looking it over, I think it will make more sense to you.

Remember, the <? extends E> is way more common (like 90%).

You can download them from the "In-Class Extras" folder up on MS Teams.
  Part2_Demo_addAll-extends-E.zip
  Part2_Demo_sort-super-E.zip

Download these individually, move each one to the workspace directory,
"extract to here," and then delete the zips.

Bring them into IntelliJ the usual way, as new module from existing source.
JUnit not needed.

Demo_addAll-extends-E:
  You really only need to study the client main-class EmployeeAddAllTest.

Demo_sort-super-E:
  Start with EmployeeHireDateComparator.
  Then review the client main-class EmployeeSortTest.
